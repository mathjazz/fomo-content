"“The policy would violate a core tenet of net neutrality, and would have harmful knock-on consequences for European consumers, creators, and innovators,” Boyd writes. For example, European consumers"

"Boyd also warns that undermining net neutrality would seriously blunt the progress of the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act. “Net neutrality is and will remain fundamental to Europe’s "
"digital future,” she writes. “I urge you to protect it.”"
