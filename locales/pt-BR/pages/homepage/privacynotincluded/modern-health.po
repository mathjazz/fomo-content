"Mozilla recently decided to offer the mental health app Modern Health to employees as part of our wellbeing program. With the growing mental health crisis around the world, many companies are adding"
" access to mental health apps to their wellbeing programs too. It can be challenging to find companies capable of meeting high privacy standards, and so we decided it was important we include a "
"review of the mental health app we offer to share what it is like to navigate these privacy concerns."

"First, a little about Modern Health. The app offers a full spectrum of mental health services, including 1:1 sessions with care professionals, guided meditations, group sessions, digital programs, "
"well-being assessments and more. Offered through your employer, access to the app is free. One of the features Modern Health offers the over 250 companies that use their service is access to "
"\"aggregated and de-identified\" data through an \"<a id=\"a1\">Insights Hub</a>\". How does Modern Health look from a privacy perspective? Well, even the mental health app Mozilla uses raises a "
"number of privacy concerns. We hope to see improvements. We will update this post when we do."

"Modern Health's <a id=\"a1\">privacy notice</a> raised flags for us because they say they can collect a large amount of personal information. For example, they recently changed their privacy policy "
"to say they \"utilize tracking technologies on our marketing website\" and they “do not engage in any third party tracking on [their] platform or target ads toward any of [their] platform members.” "
"We worry they can use information learned about users of their service for advertising purposes, and if that's not true, then we hope they clarify their privacy policy to alleviate our concerns. For"
" example, open questions we still have include: what's a \"marketing website\"? Do they engage with third party tracking off-their platform"

"They also say they can share your personal information with a number of third parties, including business affiliates and your employer. It is unclear from their privacy policy who the business "
"affiliates are and with whom they are sharing your data. Finally, Modern Health doesn’t specifically state in their privacy policy that they don’t sell user data, which is something we like to see "
"stated clearly. That's not a good thing to be unclear on. The privacy policy only confirms that they have not sold California consumers’ data, but it doesn't guarantee anything about the future or "
"people in other locations."

"What's the worst that could happen? Well, Modern Health shares data with employers. Modern Health has assured Mozilla that it only shares high-level, aggregated data with employers and does not "
