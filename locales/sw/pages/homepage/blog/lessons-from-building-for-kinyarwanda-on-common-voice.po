"It was refreshing, and frankly shocking, to witness just how intertwined industry and government are in Rwanda and how much access these groups have to each other. We learnt that government support "
"of the project led to obtaining access to over 3 million sentences in Kinyarwanda, and this has been key to the success of the project."
