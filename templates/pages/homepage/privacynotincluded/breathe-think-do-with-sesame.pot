"We're not too worried about the privacy of Sesame Workshop's mental development app for young children. TThe privacy policy does say that sometimes personal information like name and email might be "

"to have any potential child's personal information reviewed and/or removed. With an app that collects so little personal information, this is probably not too big a concern. However, the app does "
