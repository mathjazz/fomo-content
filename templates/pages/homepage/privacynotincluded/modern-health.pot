"Mozilla recently decided to offer the mental health app Modern Health to employees as part of our wellbeing program. With the growing mental health crisis around the world, many companies are adding"
" access to mental health apps to their wellbeing programs too. It can be challenging to find companies capable of meeting high privacy standards, and so we decided it was important we include a "
"review of the mental health app we offer to share what it is like to navigate these privacy concerns."

"First, a little about Modern Health. The app offers a full spectrum of mental health services, including 1:1 sessions with care professionals, guided meditations, group sessions, digital programs, "
"well-being assessments and more. Offered through your employer, access to the app is free. One of the features Modern Health offers the over 250 companies that use their service is access to "
"\"aggregated and de-identified\" data through an \"<a id=\"a1\">Insights Hub</a>\". How does Modern Health look from a privacy perspective? Well, even the mental health app Mozilla uses raises a "
"number of privacy concerns. We hope to see improvements. We will update this post when we do."
