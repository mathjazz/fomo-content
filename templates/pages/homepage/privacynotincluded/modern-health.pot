"Mozilla recently decided to offer the mental health app Modern Health to employees as part of our wellbeing program. We did this, in part, because Mozillians asked for additional mental health "
"resources. With the growing mental health crisis around the world, many companies are adding access to mental health apps to their wellbeing programs too. We decided it was important we include a "
"review of the mental health app Mozilla offers to see what it is like to navigate privacy concerns of an employer-based mental health app."

"First, a little about Modern Health. The app offers a full spectrum of mental health services, including 1:1 sessions with care professionals, guided meditations, group sessions, digital programs, "
"well-being assessments and more. Offered through your employer, access to the app if free. One of the features Modern Health offers the over 250 companies that use their service is access to an \"<a"
" id=\"a1\">Insights Hub</a>\" where companies can track registration, engagement, and usage on the app using de-anonymized data (<a id=\"a2\">here's why</a> de-anonymized data concerns us). How does"
" Modern Health look from a privacy perspective? Well, even the mental health app Mozilla uses raises a number of privacy concerns for us. Such is the state of mental health apps in the world today."

"Modern Health says they can collect a fair amount of personal information, including name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number, date of birth, IP address, location information, social "

"Modern Health goes on to say they can use information they collect on you to target you with personalized ads, send you marketing information, and conduct research. They also say they can share your"

"So yes, even the mental health app Mozilla offers employees raises a host of privacy concerns for us. One of the co-founders of Modern Health, who has since left the company, <a id=\"a1\">raised her"
" own concerns</a> about the privacy of mental health apps. And overall, employer-provided access to mental health apps raises a number of privacy concerns employees should consider before using "
"these apps. We learned first hand, it's good to reach out and talk to your company's HR or wellness department to learn what access to data your company has for such apps and what policies they have"
" in place to keep any data collected privacy, secure, and anonymous."

msgctxt "worst_case"

"What's the worst that could happen? Well, we really hope employers can't ever re-identify any of that de-identified data Modern Health shares with them. It would be terrible for your employer to "
"know that you use a mental health app, how often you use the mental health app, why you use the mental health app, and turn around to use that information to fire you. Fortunately, there are some "
"protections in place to keep that from happening. We're not too worried about that happening here at Mozilla. However, as a scenario, it doesn't feel outside of the realm of possibility when you're "
"dealing with all the data collection and sharing happening with mental health apps such as Modern Health. Here's hoping there aren't unscrupulous companies out there taking advantage of all the "
"information mental health apps can collect to spy on their employees!"
