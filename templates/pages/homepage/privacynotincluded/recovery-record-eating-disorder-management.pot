"Recovery Record makes two separate apps to help people manage eating disorders. The first is targeted at patients and is free to download and use. Called Recovery Record: Eating Disorder Management,"
" this apps helps users keep track of their meals, create customized meal plans and eating schedules, send and receive anonymous encouraging messages with other users, and share their recovery "
"journey with their treatment team. The second app, called Recovery Record for Clinicians, is designed to let eating disorder treatment professionals engage with their patients between visits to help"
" keep them on track in their recovery. The app for clinicians requires a subscription, <a id=\"a1\">costing</a> between $9 - $80. How do these apps look from a privacy perspective? Well, it's not a "
"good sign when your eating disorder recovery app lets you use the weak password \"111111\" to sign on. And their privacy policy raised a number of concerns for us too. üòû"

"Recovery Record's privacy policy, last updated in September 2019. leaves us feeling uneasy. It's good they say they won't sell or share information about you for their direct marketing purposes "
"<i>without your permission</i>. That does mean it's on you to keep track of when they ask permission and opt out. It wasn't exactly clear to us how that permission was obtained...we found one "
"statement that indicated by downloading and using the app, you gave them permission and to revoke permission you needed to delete your account."

"The app does collect a fair amount of personal and usage data, including name, age, gender, city/town, and email address. They also say \"<i>clinicians and support persons involved in your care may "
"provide us information, including protected health information, about you</i>.\" They do say <a id=\"a1\">US HIPAA privacy laws</a> requires them \"<i>to, among other things, apply reasonable and "
"appropriate measures to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of this information.</i>\" This is a fine line it seems many mental health apps walk -- the line between the "
"privacy protections therapists are required to follow under HIPAA laws and the current data economy apps operate under that leads to the collection of personal information to provide and market "
"their paid services. We find it a bit confusing and more than a bit worrisome what is shared and what is protected."

"Another line from Recovery Record's privacy policy that worries us reads, <i>\"From time to time, we may desire to use information about you for uses not previously disclosed in this Privacy Policy."
" If our practices change regarding previously collected information in a way that would be materially less restrictive than stated in the version of this Privacy Policy in effect at the time we "
"collected the information, we will make reasonable efforts to provide notice and obtain consent to any such uses as may be required by law</i>.\" All that sounds like it could be fine. However, it "
"also feels vaguely worded enough to us to feel like Recovery Record has built in some wiggle room to use your personal information in ways you might not expect or even be able to consent to. These "
"sorts of broad, vague statements in privacy policies always worry us."

"Recovery Record's privacy policy leaves us concerned. As does the fact that they don't meet our Minimum Security Standards because users could use a weak password such as \"111111\" to protect their"
" account. Finally, we'll end with one more statement from Recovery Record's privacy policy that serves as a warning for everything shared on the internet, \"<i>Unfortunately, the Internet and mobile"
" networks over which our Services are delivered cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. We do not accept liability "
"for unintentional disclosure</i>. \" What's the worst that could happen. Well, we worry that your very sensitive eating disorder information could wind up in the hands of someone you really don't "
"want to have that information and that doesn't sound healthy at all."
